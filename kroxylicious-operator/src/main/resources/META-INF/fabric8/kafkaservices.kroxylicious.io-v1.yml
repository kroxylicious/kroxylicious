                    Declares the ranges of node ids present in the Kafka Cluster this KafkaService refers to. Default 
                    value is a single range starting with node id 0 and ending with 2 inclusive. Note that if you wish
                    to expose this cluster using plain (non-TLS) connections it is desirable to use a compact set of
                    node id ranges, as every node id in every range requires a distinct listening port.
