# Kroxylicious HashiCorp KMS Provider for Topic Encryption

## What is it?

An implementation of the KMS (Key Management System) interface backed by a remote instance of Hashicorp Vault (v1).

It allows the Topic Encryption filter to be used with encryption keys stored with a HashiCorp Vault(TM)
instance.  The instance may be a locally deployed instance, or could be a HashiCorp Vault instance provided by 
HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) .

## How do I use it?

These are interim instructions.  For the moment please refer to the [Record Encryption Kubernetes Example](../kubernetes-examples/record-encryption/).
Instructions to deploy the example are found in the [Developer Guide](../DEV_GUIDE.md).
