# CHANGELOG

This changelog enumerates **all user-facing** changes made to Kroxylicious, in reverse chronological order.
For changes that effect a public API, the [deprecation policy](./DEV_GUIDE.md#deprecation-policy) is followed.

Format `<github issue/pr number>: <short description>`.

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The deprecated EnvelopeEncryption filter is now removed.  Use RecordEncryption instead.
* The deprecated forwardPartialRequests option has been removed from the Record Validation Filter.
* This release upgrades Kroxylicious to Jackson 2.18 which "[improves](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4785#issuecomment-2463105965)" how jackson handles constructor detection which may lead to issues with filter config.
If after the upgrade you observe issues similar to
`com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidDefinitionException: Invalid type definition for type `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.tofix.CreatorResolutionTest$HostPort`: Argument #0 of Creator [method com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.tofix.CreatorResolutionTest$HostPort#parse(java.lang.String)] has no property name (and is not Injectable): can not use as property-based Creator`
then you need to add `@JsonCreator(mode = JsonCreator.Mode.DELEGATING)` to the constructor one expects Jackson to use.

* [#1154](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/pull/1154): Apicurio based schema validation filter

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The Record Encryption Filter now uses `AES/GCM/NoPadding` as the transformation String and checks the KMS 
returns a 256bit DEK. This enables users to configure an alternative JCE Provider in their JRE configuration
that offers this algorithm.
* FilterFactoryContext#eventLoop() is deprecated, replaced by FilterFactoryContext#filterDispatchExecutor().
This returns FilterDispatchExecutor, a new interface extending ScheduledExecutorService. FilterDispatchExecutor
has methods to enable Filters to check if the current thread is the Filter Dispatch Thread and it offers
specialized futures, where chained async methods will also run on the Filter Dispatch Thread when no executor
is supplied. This is intended to be a tool to make it convenient for Filters to hand off work to uncontrolled
threads, then switch back to an execution context where mutation of Filter members is safe.
* Record Encryption Filter: Data Encryption Keys will now be refreshed one hour after creation by default.
This is a bugfix for [#1139](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/issues/1339) to ensure we start
using new key material after key-encryption-keys are rotated in the KMS within some controlled duration.
* **Breaking changes to public kroxylicious-api module**, Filter Authors may be affected

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* RangeAwarePortPerNodeClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider is a new ClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider that is capable of modelling
more target topologies using a compact set of ports. Users can declare multiple ranges of node ids that exist in the target cluster
and the proxy will map those ranges on to a minimal set of proxy ports. See the [Virtual Cluster configuration docs](https://kroxylicious.io/kroxylicious/#_rangeawareportpernode_scheme)
for more information.

* [#885](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/pull/885): Bump kroxy.extension.version from 0.8.0 to 0.8.1

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* EncryptionVersion 1 is no longer supported, we found that it had diverged from our design document and have corrected it. From release 0.5.0 we guarantee backwards compatibility from EncryptionVersion 2 onwards.
* **We have renamed the EnvelopeEncryption filter** it is now the **RecordEncryption** filter. As this is a more accurate description of its role. We have not changed the way we deliver the encryption-at-rest as we are still using Envelope Encryption. Note we have preserved an `EnvelopeEncryption` factory, albeit deprecated, to avoid runtime failures for users upgrading from `0.4.x`. 
* When configuring TLS, the property `filePath` for specifying the location of a file providing the password is now
  deprecated.  Use `passwordFile` instead.
* When configuring TLS, it is no longer valid to pass a null inline password like `"storePassword": {"password": null}` instead use `"storePassword": null`
* As a result of the work of #909, some superfluous transitive dependencies have been removed from some kroxylicious.  If you were relying on those, you will need to
  adjust your dependencies as your adopt this release.
* `io.kroxylicious:kroxylicious-filter-test-support` now contains RecordTestUtils for creating example `Record`, `RecordBatch` and `MemoryRecords`. It also contains 
  assertj assertions for those same classes to enable us to write fluent assertions, accessible via `io.kroxylicious.test.assertj.KafkaAssertions`.
* The configuration for VaultKMS service has changed.
  * Instead of the `vaultUrl` config key, the provider now requires `vaultTransitEngineUrl`.  This must provide the
    complete path to the Transit Engine on the HashiCorp Vault instance (e.g. https://myvault:8200/v1/transit or
    https://myvault:8200/v1/mynamespace/transit).
  * The `vaultToken` field now requires a `PasswordProvider` object rather than inline text value.   You may pass the
    token from a file (filename specified by a `passwordFile` field) or inline (`password` field).  The latter is not
    recommended in production environments.
* The deprecated CompositeFilter interface has been removed.
* Container images for releases will be published to quay.io/kroxylicious/kroxylicious (rather than kroxylicious-developer)
* `FetchResponseTransformationFilter` now uses configuration key `transformationConfig` (rather than `config`). This matches
  the configuration expected by `ProduceRequestTransformationFilter`.

## 0.4.1

* [#836](https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/pull/836): Cache decrypted EDEK and resolved aliases

### Changes, deprecations and removals

* The `ProduceRequestTransformationFilter` and `FetchResponseTransformationFilter` have been moved to their own module kroxylicious-simple-transform.
  If you were depending on these filters, you must ensure that the kroxylicious-simple-transform JAR file is added to your classpath.  The
  Javadoc of these classes has been updated to convey the fact that these filters are *not* intended for production use.

## 0.3.0

### Changes, deprecations and removals

The Filter API is refactored to be fully asynchronous.  Filter API methods such as `#onXxxxRequest` and `onXxxxResponse`
now are required to return a `CompletionStage<FilterResult>`. The `FilterResult` encapsulates the message to be
forwarded and carries orders (such as close the connection). The context provides factory methods for creating
`FilterResult` objects.

The default metrics port has changed from 9193 to 9190 to prevent port collisions

Filter Authors can now implement CompositeFilter if they want a single configuration block to contribute multiple Filters
to the Filter chain. This enables them to write smaller, more focused Filter implementations but deliver them as a whole
behaviour with a single block of configuration in the Kroxylicious configuration yaml. This interface is mutually exclusive
with RequestFilter, ResponseFilter or any specific message Filter interfaces.

In the kroxylicious config, the brokerAddressPattern parameter for the PortPerBroker scheme no longer accepts or requires
:$(portNumber) suffix.  In addition, for the SniRouting scheme the config now enforces that there is no port specifier
present on the brokerAddressPattern parameter. Previously, it was accepted but would lead to a failure later.

Kroxylicious configuration no longer requires a non empty `filters` list, users can leave it unset or configure in an empty
list of filters and Kroxylicious will proxy to the cluster successfully.

The Contributor API for creating filters has been significantly changed. 

- `FilterContributor` is renamed `FilterFactory`. 
- Filter Authors will now implement one FilterFactory implementation for each Filter implementation. So the cardinality is now one-to-one.
- We now identify which filter we want to load using it's class name or simple class name,
for example `io.kroxylicious.filter.SpecialFilter` or `SpecialFilter`.
- `FilterConstructContext` is renamed `FilterCreateContext`
- FilterExecutors is removed from FilterCreateContext and the `eventloop()` method is pulled up to FilterCreateContext.
- BaseConfig is removed and any Jackson deserializable type can be used as config.
- configuration is no longer part of the FilterCreateContext, it is supplied as a parameter to the `FilterFactory#createFilter(..)` method.

The names used to identify port-per-broker and sni-routing schemes in the Kroxylicious configuration have changed:
- `PortPerBroker` -> `PortPerBrokerClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider`
- `SniRouting` -> `SniRoutingClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider`

The names used to identify micrometer configuration hooks in configuration have changed:
- `CommonTagsContributor` -> `CommonTagsHook`
- `StandardBindersContributor` -> `StandardBindersHook`
-
