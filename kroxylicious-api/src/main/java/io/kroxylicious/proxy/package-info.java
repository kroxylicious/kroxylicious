/**
 * <p>The API for writing protocol filters (aka interceptors).</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link io.kroxylicious.proxy.filter.Filter} is the base interface for filters,
 * with a subinterface for each request and response API (e.g. {@link io.kroxylicious.proxy.filter.ProduceRequestFilter}).</p>
 *
 * <p>Filter plugins can multiply inherit several of the per-RPC interfaces if they need to intercept several kinds
 * of request and/or response.</p>
 *
 *
 * <h2 id='assumptions'>Important facts about the Kafka protocol</h2>
 *
 * <h3 id='pipelining'>Pipelining</h3>
 * <p>The Kafka protocol supports pipelining (meaning a client can send multiple requests,
 * before getting a response for any of them). Therefore when writing a filter implementation
 * do not assume you won't see multiple requests before seeing any corresponding responses.</p>
 *
 * <h3 id='ordering'>Ordering</h3>
 * <p>A broker does not, in general, send responses in the same order as it receives requests.
 * Therefore when writing a filter implementation do not assume ordering.</p>
 *
 * <h3 id='local_view'>Local view</h3>
 * <p>A client may obtain information from one broker in a cluster and use it to interact with other
 * brokers in the cluster (or the same broker, but on a different connection, and therefore a different
 * channel and filter chain). A classic example would
 * be a producer or consumer making a metadata connection and {@code Metadata} request to a broker and
 * then connecting to a partition leader to producer/consume records ({@code Produce} and {@code Fetch} requests).</p>
 *
 * <p>So although your filter
 * <em>implementation</em> might intercept both {@code Metadata} and {@code Produce} request/response
 * (for example), those requests will not pass through the same <em>instance</em> of your filter
 * implementation. Therefore it is incorrect, in general, to assume your filter has a global view of
 * the communication between the client and broker.</p>
