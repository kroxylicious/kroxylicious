== Replacement matchers

Replacement matchers control how field values are matched and transformed.
A replacement matcher is defined using this format:

[source]
----
/<matching regular expression>/<replacement>/<flags>
----
where:

* `<matching regular expression>` is the regular expression used to test the field value.
* `<replacement>` defines the replacement value to use when the regular expression is matched.
The replacement can use back references (`$1` etc) to refer to capturing groups defined within the regular expression.
* `<flags>` (optional) can be either `L` or `U` for lower or upper-casing respectively.
The case transformation is applied to the replacement value after any back reference resolution.
