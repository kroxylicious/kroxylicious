= Preparing AWS KMS

[role="_abstract"]
To prepare {aws}/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html[AWS Key Management Service] for use with the Record Encryption filter, use the following setup:

* Establish an AWS KMS aliasing convention for keys
* Create a policies giving permissions to the key aliases
* Create a user for use by the filter and attach the policies to it.

You'll need a privileged AWS user that is capable of creating users and policies to perform the set-up.
