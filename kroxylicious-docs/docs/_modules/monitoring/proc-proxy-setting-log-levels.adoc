= Setting log levels

[role="_abstract"]

The Kroxylicious {github-release}[binary distribution^] includes https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x[log4j2] as the default logging backend.

When using the `bin/kroxylicious-start.sh` script from the binary distribution, you can set an environment variable to load a custom `log4j2` configuration file or change the root logging level.

.Environment variable to load a custom `log4j2` file
[source,properties]
----
KROXYLICIOUS_LOGGING_OPTIONS="-Dlog4j2.configurationFile=/path/to/custom/log4j2.yaml"
----

.Environment variable to change the root logging level
[source,properties]
----
KROXYLICIOUS_ROOT_LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG"
----

NOTE: Setting the root log level to `DEBUG` or `TRACE` will produce very verbose logs.
