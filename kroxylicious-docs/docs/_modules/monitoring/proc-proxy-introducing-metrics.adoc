= Introducing metrics

[role="_abstract"]
If you want to introduce metrics to your Kroxylicious deployment, you can configure an insecure HTTP and Prometheus endpoint (at `/metrics`).

Add the following to the `ConfigMap` resource that defines the Kroxylicious configuration:

.Minimal metrics configuration
[source,yaml]
----
management:
  endpoints:
    prometheus: {}
----

By default, the HTTP endpoint listens on `0.0.0.0:9190`.
You can change the bind address and port as follows:

.Example metrics configuration with bind address and port
[source,yaml]
----
management:
  bindAddress: 127.0.0.1
  port: 9999
  endpoints:
    prometheus: {}
----
