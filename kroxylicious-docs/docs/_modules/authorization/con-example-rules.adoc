= Example ACL Rules

[role="_abstract"]
If your instance of the Kroxylicious Proxy runs directly on an operating system, provide a file containing the rules
and reference it from the proxy configuration.

Save the file with a name of your choice and reference it in the filter configuration.
The following example shows an ACL rules file referenced as `acl-rules.txt`:

[source]
----
from io.kroxylicious.filter.authorization import TopicResource as Topic;
deny User with name = "alice" to * Topic with name = "payments-received";
allow User with name = "alice" to * Topic with name like "payments-*";
allow User with name = "bob" to * Topic with name = "payments-received";
otherwise deny;
