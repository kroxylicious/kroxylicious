= Configuring network and Netty settings

[role="_abstract"]
The proxy allows configuration of network settings for both the proxy endpoints (client-facing) and management endpoints using the `network.proxy` and `network.management` properties.
These settings control low-level Netty behavior and are optional, with sensible defaults provided.

network:
  proxy: # <1>
    workerThreadCount: 8 # <2>
    shutdownQuietPeriodSeconds: 10 # <3>
  management: # <4>
    workerThreadCount: 2
    shutdownQuietPeriodSeconds: 5

----
<1> Network settings for the proxy endpoints that handle client connections.
<2> Optional: Number of Netty worker threads for handling concurrent connections. Defaults to twice the number of available processors.
<3> Optional: Grace period in seconds during which the proxy continues processing existing connections before shutting down. Defaults to 0.
<4> Network settings for the management HTTP endpoints. Can be configured independently from proxy settings.

* All network settings are optional. The proxy will use sensible defaults if not specified.
* The `workerThreadCount` setting allows tuning for high-concurrency deployments. Increasing this value can improve throughput when handling many simultaneous client connections.
* The `shutdownQuietPeriodSeconds` setting provides a graceful shutdown window, allowing in-flight requests to complete before the proxy terminates.
* Proxy and management endpoints can have different thread pool sizes and shutdown behaviors based on their different workload characteristics.
