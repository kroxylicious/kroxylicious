= Understanding the `KafkaProxyIngress` `ResolvedRefs` condition

[role="_abstract"]
The status of a `KafkaProxyIngress` resource includes a `ResolvedRefs` condition to report on the validity of its resource references. 
This condition indicates whether the `KafkaProxy` specified in the `spec.proxyRef` has been successfully resolved.

When you create a `KafkaProxyIngress`, the operator checks whether a `KafkaProxy` corresponding to the `spec.proxyRef` exists.
The result is reported in `status.conditions` with a `ResolvedRefs` condition accordingly.

.Example `KafkaProxyIngress` status when `spec.proxyRef` exists
[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaProxyIngress
apiVersion: kroxylicious.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: cluster-ip
  namespace: my-proxy
  generation: 12
spec:
  # ...
status:
  observedGeneration: 12 # <1>
  conditions:
    - type: ResolvedRefs # <2>
      status: True # <3>
      observedGeneration: 12
----
<1> The `observedGeneration` in the status matches the `metadata.generation`, indicating that the status is up-to-date for the latest `spec`.
<2> The `ResolvedRefs` condition type reports any issues with referenced resources.
<3> A status value of `True` means that all referenced resources exist. 

A status value of `False` means that the `KafkaProxy` resource is missing. In this case, the condition includes `reason` and `message` properties with more details.
