= Configuring idle connection timeouts

[role="_abstract"]
The proxy can automatically disconnect idle client connections to reclaim resources.
Idle timeout configuration is completely optional and disabled by default, allowing you to opt in only when needed for your deployment.

== Two-stage timeout mechanism

The proxy supports two independent idle timeout settings that apply at different stages of the connection lifecycle:

* **Unauthenticated timeout** (`unAuthenticatedIdleTimeout`) - Applies to connections where the proxy cannot detect the completion of authentication. The proxy considers authentication to be complete if either of the following hold true:
1. A transport subject builder creates a subject with an identity. Usually this would be from a client TLS certificate.
2. A SASL inspection or termination filter has invoked `io.kroxylicious.proxy.filter.FilterContext.clientSaslAuthenticationSuccess` method.
* **Authenticated timeout** (`authenticatedIdleTimeout`) - Applies to connections where an identity can be established. This timeout applies for the remainder of the connection's lifetime.

Both timeout settings are optional and have no default values.
You can configure one, both, or neither depending on your requirements.
Timeout values use ISO-8601 duration format (for example, `PT30s` for 30 seconds, `PT5m` for 5 minutes, `PT1h` for 1 hour).

== Configuration examples

.Example: Unauthenticated timeout only
[source,yaml]
----
network:
  proxy:
    unAuthenticatedIdleTimeout: PT30s # <1>
virtualClusters:
  # ...
----
<1> Disconnect connections that remain unauthenticated for more than 30 seconds.

.Example: Authenticated timeout only
[source,yaml]
----
network:
  proxy:
    authenticatedIdleTimeout: PT5m # <1>
virtualClusters:
  # ...
----
<1> Disconnect authenticated connections that are idle for more than 5 minutes.

.Example: Both timeouts configured
[source,yaml]
----
network:
  proxy:
    unAuthenticatedIdleTimeout: PT30s # <1>
    authenticatedIdleTimeout: PT10m # <2>
virtualClusters:
  # ...
----
<1> Disconnect unauthenticated connections after 30 seconds of inactivity.
<2> Disconnect authenticated connections after 10 minutes of inactivity.

== When to enable idle timeouts

Consider enabling idle timeouts in the following scenarios:

* **Misbehaving clients** - Clients that abandon connections without properly closing them, leaving resources allocated unnecessarily.
* **High-scale deployments** - Environments with many clients where connection resources (memory, file descriptors) are constrained.
* **Connection exhaustion prevention** - Deployments approaching operating system or network limits on concurrent connections.
* **Network infrastructure requirements** - Environments where network infrastructure (firewalls, load balancers) drops idle connections, and you want the proxy to disconnect gracefully first.
* **Different security postures** - Scenarios where unauthenticated connections require stricter timeouts than authenticated connections for security reasons.

== When not to enable idle timeouts

Avoid enabling idle timeouts in the following scenarios:

* **Legitimate idle connections** - Applications where clients maintain long-lived connections with extended idle periods, such as consumers with long poll timeouts or applications using connection pooling.
* **Stable network infrastructure** - Environments with reliable network infrastructure and no issues with idle connection management.
* **Minimal overhead desired** - Deployments where the proxy's monitoring overhead should be kept to an absolute minimum.
* **No resource constraints** - Systems with ample connection resources and no risk of connection exhaustion.

== Monitoring idle disconnects

The proxy tracks idle disconnects using the `kroxylicious_client_to_proxy_idle_disconnects_total` metric.
This counter is incremented each time a connection is closed due to exceeding the configured idle timeout.
