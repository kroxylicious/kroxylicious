= Creating HashiCorp Vault keys

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure describes how to create AES-256 symmetric keys for use with the Record Encryption filter. The process uses the HashiCorp CLI to create a key following your key naming convention, with a 90-day rotation policy.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the HashiCorp CLI.
* Sufficient permissions to create keys.

.Procedure

. Create a symmetric key
+
[source, shell]
----
vault write -f transit/keys/KEK-trades type=aes256-gcm96 auto_rotate_period=90d
----
* The key type must be `aes256-gcm96`, which is Vault's default key type.

TIP: It is recommended to use a key rotation policy.
