= Creating Azure Key Vault keys

[role="_abstract"]
As a user with the *Key Vault Crypto Officer* role (or otherwise sufficient {microsoft-learn}/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli#azure-built-in-roles-for-key-vault-data-plane-operations[RBAC] or {microsoft-learn}/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-access-policy[legacy] permissions to manage keys in Azure Key Vault), use either the {microsoft-learn}/cli/azure/keyvault/key?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-key-create[Azure CLI] or {microsoft-learn}/powershell/module/az.keyvault/add-azkeyvaultkey[Azure PowerShell] to create a *key* with *wrapKey* and *unwrapKey* operations enabled.

== Establish the naming convention for keys within key vault hierarchy

Establish a naming convention for keys to keep the filter’s keys separate from those used by other systems.

NOTE: The filter key name prefix `KEK_` is used widely across the Kroxylicious project, including here in the documentation, as well as in the quickstarts, developer guides, examples, and scripts. However, *Azure Key Vault does not permit underscore characters in key names*, so Azure Key Vault users will have to adjust this naming scheme as required.

== Supported Key Types

NOTE: The key types available to you in Azure Key Vault will depend on your Azure Key Vault service tier. See the {microsoft-learn}/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys[_About keys_ page in the Azure Key Vault docs] for more details.

The filter accepts the following {microsoft-learn}/rest/api/keyvault/keys/create-key/create-key?view=rest-keyvault-keys-2025-07-01&tabs=HTTP#jsonwebkeytype[key types] and their associated {microsoft-learn}/rest/api/keyvault/keys/wrap-key/wrap-key?view=rest-keyvault-keys-2025-07-01&tabs=HTTP#jsonwebkeyencryptionalgorithm[wrapping algorithms]:

* *Symmetric Keys (`oct` or `oct-HSM`):* Uses the quantum-resistant `A256GCM` (256-bit AES GCM) wrapping algorithm, which {microsoft-learn}/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys-details#symmetric-key-algorithms-managed-hsm-only[requires a Managed HSM subscription].
* *Asymmetric Keys (`RSA` or `RSA-HSM`):* Uses the `RSA-OAEP-256` (RSAES-OAEP with SHA-256 hash and MGF1/SHA-256 mask) wrapping algorithm, which is not quantum-resistant. This wrapping algorithm {microsoft-learn}/azure/key-vault/keys/about-keys-details#wrapkeyunwrapkey-encryptdecrypt[does not require a Managed HSM subscription to use] (however, `RSA-HSM` is not available without a premium Azure Key Vault subscription).

If you use the Azure CLI, you can create a key with a command similar to the following:

[source,shell]
----
KEY_VAULT_NAME="kroxylicious-key-vault"
KEY_NAME="KEK_<name>"
KEY_TYPE="oct"
az keyvault key create --vault-name ${KEY_VAULT_NAME} --name ${KEY_NAME} --kty ${KEY_TYPE} --ops wrapKey unwrapKey
----
* Change `KEY_TYPE` if you want to use a key type other than oct.
* The `wrapKey` and `unwrapKey` operations must be enabled.

When the key is created, it is recommended to use a key rotation policy.

NOTE: Key autorotation (such as automatic rotation of keys according to a policy) has an additional cost per scheduled key rotation in Azure Key Vault. Details can be found on the {azure}/pricing/details/key-vault/[Azure Key Vault pricing page].

To configure a key rotation policy with the Azure CLI, save your policy to a JSON file. An example JSON file can be found in the {microsoft-learn}/cli/azure/keyvault/key/rotation-policy?view=azure-cli-latest#az-keyvault-key-rotation-policy-update[Azure CLI docs].

When you've prepared your policy, apply it with a command like this:

[source,shell]
----
az keyvault key rotation-policy update --vault-name ${VAULT_NAME} --name ${KEY_NAME} --value path/to/my_policy.json
----
