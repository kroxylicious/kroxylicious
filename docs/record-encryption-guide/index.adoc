The Kroxylicious Record Encryption filter enhances the security of Kafka messages.
The filter uses industry-standard cryptographic techniques to apply encryption to Kafka messages, ensuring the confidentiality of data stored in the Kafka Cluster.
By centralizing topic-level encryption, Kroxylicious provides streamlined protection across Kafka clusters.

To use the filter, follow these steps:

1. Set up a Key Management System (KMS)
2. Establish encryption keys within the KMS for securing the topics
3. Configure the filter within Kroxylicious

The filter integrates with a Key Management Service (KMS), which is responsible for the safe storage of sensitive key material.
Kroxylicious supports the following KMS providers:

* HashiCorp Vault
* AWS Key Management Service.
ifdef::include-fortanix-dsm-kms[]
* Fortanix DSM
endif::[]

You can provide implementations for your specific KMS systems.
Additional KMS support may be added based on demand.
