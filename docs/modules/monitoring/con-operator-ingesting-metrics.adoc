= Ingesting metrics

[role="_abstract"]
Metrics from the Kroxylicious Proxy and Kroxylicious Operator can be ingested into your Prometheus instance.
The proxy and the operator each expose an HTTP endpoint for Prometheus metrics at the `/metrics` address.
The endpoint does not require authentication.

For the Proxy, the port that exposes the scrape endpoint is named `management`.
For the Operator, the port is named `http`.

Prometheus can be configured to ingest the metrics from the scrape endpoints.

This guide assumes you are using the https://prometheus-operator.dev/[Prometheus Operator] to configure Prometheus.
