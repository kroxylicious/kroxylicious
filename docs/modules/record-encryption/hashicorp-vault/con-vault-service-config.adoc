= Configuring the HashiCorp Vault KMS

For HashiCorp Vault, the KMS configuration looks like this.
Use the Vault Token and Vault Transit Engine URL values from the KMS setup.

[source, yaml]
----
kms: VaultKmsService                                          # <1>
kmsConfig:
  vaultTransitEngineUrl: <vault transit engine service url>   # <2>
  tls:                                                        # <3>
  vaultToken:                                                 # <4>
    passwordFile: /opt/vault/token
