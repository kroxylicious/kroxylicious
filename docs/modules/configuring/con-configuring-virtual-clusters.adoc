= Configuring virtual clusters

[role="_abstract"]
A Kafka cluster is represented by the proxy as a virtual cluster. 
Clients connect to the virtual cluster rather than the actual cluster.
When Kroxylicious is deployed, it includes configuration to create virtual clusters. 

A virtual cluster has exactly one target cluster, but many virtual clusters can target the same cluster.
Each virtual cluster targets a single listener on the target cluster, so multiple listeners on the Kafka side are represented as multiple virtual clusters by the proxy.
Clients connect to a virtual cluster using a `bootstrapServers` address.
The virtual cluster has a bootstrap address that maps to each broker in the target cluster.
When a client connects to the proxy, communication is proxied to the target broker by rewriting the address.
Responses back to clients are rewritten to reflect the appropriate network addresses of the virtual clusters. 

You can secure virtual cluster connections from clients and to target clusters.

Kroxylicious accepts keys and certificates in  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail), PKCS #12 (Public-Key Cryptography Standards), or JKS (Java KeyStore) keystore format.
