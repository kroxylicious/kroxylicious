= Configuring Proxy container CPU and memory resource limits and requests

When you define a `KafkaProxy` resource, a number of Kubernetes `Pods` are created, each with a proxy container.
Each of these containers runs a single Kroxylicious Proxy process.

By default, these proxy containers are defined without resource limits.

You can learn more about Kubernetes resource management https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[here].

To manage CPU and memory consumption in your environment, modify the `proxyContainer` section within your `KafkaProxy` specification.
