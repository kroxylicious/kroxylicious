= Configuring TLS client authentication with the `KafkaService` resource

You can use the `KafkaService` resource to configure the proxy to present a TLS client certificate to the proxied Kafka cluster, if the cluster implements mutual TLS authentication (mTLS).

The TLS client certificate you provide must have been issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that's trusted by the proxied cluster.

This example configures a `KafkaService` to use a TLS client certificate stored in a `Secret` named `tls-cert-for-kafka.example.com`.

.Example `KafkaService` configuration with TLS client authentication.
[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaService
metadata:
  # ...
spec:
  bootstrapServers: kafka.example.com:9092
  tls:
    trustAnchorRef:
      kind: ConfigMap
      name: trusted-cas
      key: trusted-cas.pem
    certificateRef: # <1>
      kind: Secret # <2>
      name: tls-cert-for-kafka.example.com # <3>
    # ...
----
<1> The `certificateRef` property identifies the TLS client certificate to use.
<2> The `kind` is optional and defaults to `Secret`. The `Secret` should have `type: kubernetes.io/tls`.
<3> The `name` is the name of the resource of the given `kind`. This resource must exist in the same namespace as the `KafkaService`
