= Configuring virtual cluster network addresses

[role="_abstract"]
Virtual cluster configuration requires a network address configuration provider that determines how the brokers in the Kafka cluster are presented to clients in terms of broker ids, hostnames, and ports.

Kroxylicious has the following built-in providers:

* Broker address provider (`PortPerBrokerClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider`)
* Node ID ranges provider (`RangeAwarePortPerNodeClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider`)
* SNI routing address provider (`SniRoutingClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider`)

IMPORTANT: Make sure that the virtual cluster bootstrap address and generated broker addresses are resolvable and routable by the Kafka client.

== Broker address provider

The per-broker network address configuration provider opens one port for a virtual clusterâ€™s bootstrap address and one port for each broker in the target Kafka cluster. 
The number of open ports is maintained dynamically. 
For example, if a broker is removed from the cluster, the port assigned to it is closed.
If you have two virtual clusters, each targeting a Kafka cluster with three brokers, eight ports are bound in total.

This provider works best with straightforward configurations. 
Ideally, the target cluster should have sequential, stable broker IDs and a known minimum broker ID, such as 0, 1, 2 for a cluster with three brokers. While it can handle non-sequential broker IDs, this would require exposing ports equal to `maxBrokerId - minBrokerId`, which could be excessive if your cluster contains broker IDs like `0` and `20000`.

The provider supports both cleartext and TLS downstream connections.

.Example broker address configuration
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
virtualClusters:
  my-cluster-proxy:
    # ...
    clusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider:
      type: PortPerBrokerClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider
      config:
        bootstrapAddress: mycluster.kafka.com:9192 # <1>
        brokerAddressPattern: mybroker-$(nodeId).mycluster.kafka.com # <2>
        brokerStartPort: 9193 # <3>
        numberOfBrokerPorts: 3 # <4>
        lowestTargetBrokerId: 1000 # <5>
        bindAddress: 192.168.0.1 # <6>
    # ...
# ...
----
<1> The hostname and port of the bootstrap address used by Kafka clients.
<2> (Optional) The broker address pattern used to form broker addresses. If not defined, it defaults to the hostname part of the bootstrap address and the port number allocated to the broker. 
<3> (Optional) The starting number for the broker port range. Defaults to the port of the bootstrap address plus 1.
<4> (Optional) The maximum number of broker ports that are permitted. Set this value according to the maximum number of brokers allowed by your operational rules. Defaults to 3.
<5> (Optional) The lowest broker ID in the target cluster. Defaults to 0. This should match the lowest https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_node.id[`node.id`] (or https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_broker.id[`broker.id`]) in the target cluster.
<6> (Optional) The bind address used when binding the ports. If undefined, all network interfaces are bound.

Each broker's ID must be greater than or equal to `lowestTargetBrokerId` and less than `lowestTargetBrokerId + numberOfBrokerPorts`.
The current strategy for mapping node IDs to ports is as follows: `nodeId -> brokerStartPort + nodeId - lowestTargetBrokerId`.
The example configuration maps broker IDs 1000, 1001, and 1002 to ports 9193, 9194, and 9195, respectively. 
Reconfigure `numberOfBrokerPorts` to accommodate the number of brokers in the cluster.

The example broker address configuration creates the following broker addresses:

[source,shell]
----
mybroker-0.mycluster.kafka.com:9193
mybroker-1.mycluster.kafka.com:9194
mybroker-2.mycluster.kafka.com:9194
----

The `brokerAddressPattern` configuration parameter accepts the `$(nodeId)` replacement token, which is optional. 
If included, `$(nodeId)` is replaced by the broker's https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_node.id[`node.id`] (or https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#brokerconfigs_broker.id[`broker.id`]) in the target cluster.

For example, with the configuration shown above, if your cluster has three brokers, your Kafka client receives broker addresses like this:

[source]
----
0.  mybroker-0.mycluster.kafka.com:9193
1.  mybroker-1.mycluster.kafka.com:9194
2.  mybroker-2.mycluster.kafka.com:9195
----

== Node ID ranges provider

As an alternative to the broker address provider, the node ID ranges provider allows you to model specific ranges of node IDs in the target cluster, enabling efficient port allocation even when broker IDs are non-sequential or widely spaced
This ensures a deterministic mapping of node IDs to ports while minimizing the number of ports needed.

.Example node ID ranges configuration
[source, yaml]
----
# ...
virtualClusters:
  my-cluster-proxy:
    # ...
    clusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider:
      type: RangeAwarePortPerNodeClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider
      config:
        bootstrapAddress: mycluster.kafka.com:9192
        brokerAddressPattern: mybroker-$(nodeId).mycluster.kafka.com
        brokerStartPort: 9193
        nodeIdRanges: # <1>
          - name: brokers # <2>
            range:
              startInclusive: 0 # <3>
              endExclusive: 3 # <4>
    # ...
# ...
----
<1> The list of Node ID ranges, which must not be empty.
<2> The name of the range, which must be unique within the `nodeIdRanges` list.
<3> The start of the range (inclusive).
<4> The end of the range (exclusive). It must be greater than `startInclusive`; empty ranges are not allowed.

Node ID ranges must be distinct, meaning a node ID cannot belong to more than one range.

KRaft roles given to cluster nodes can be accommodated in the configuration.
For example, consider a target cluster using KRaft with the following node IDs and roles:

* nodeId: 0, roles: controller
* nodeId: 1, roles: controller
* nodeId: 2, roles: controller
* nodeId: 1000, roles: broker
* nodeId: 1001, roles: broker
* nodeId: 1002, roles: broker
* nodeId: 99999, roles: broker

This can be modeled as three node ID ranges, as shown in the following example.

.Example node ID ranges configuration with KRaft roles
[source, yaml]
----
# ...
virtualClusters:
  my-cluster-proxy:
    # ...
    clusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider:
      type: RangeAwarePortPerNodeClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider
      config:
        bootstrapAddress: mycluster.kafka.com:9192
        nodeIdRanges:
          - name: controller
            range:
              startInclusive: 0
              endExclusive: 3
          - name: brokers
            range:
              startInclusive: 1000
              endExclusive: 1003
          - name: broker-outlier
            range:
              startInclusive: 99999
              endExclusive: 100000
    # ...
# ...
----

This configuration results in the following mapping from node ID to port:

* nodeId: 0 -> port 9193
* nodeId: 1 -> port 9194
* nodeId: 2 -> port 9195
* nodeId: 1000 -> port 9196
* nodeId: 1001 -> port 9197
* nodeId: 1002 -> port 9198
* nodeId: 99999 -> port 9199

== SNI routing address provider

The SNI (Server Name Indication) routing provider opens a single port for all virtual clusters or a port for each. 
You can open a port for the whole cluster or each broker.   
The SNI routing provider uses SNI information to determine where to route the traffic, so requires downstream TLS.  

.Example SNI routing address provider configuration
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
virtualClusters:
  my-cluster-proxy:
    # ...
    clusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider:
      type: SniRoutingClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider
      config:
        bootstrapAddress: mycluster.kafka.com:9192 # <1>
        brokerAddressPattern: mybroker-$(nodeId).mycluster.kafka.com
        bindAddress: 192.168.0.1
    # ...
# ...
----
<1> A single address for all traffic, including bootstrap address and brokers.
                                      
In the SNI routing address configuration, the `advertisedBrokerAddressPattern` specification is mandatory, as it is required to generate routes for each broker.
`advertisedBrokerAddressPattern` can optionally end with a port specifier, which is the port that will be advertised to the client. This is only relevant if
Kroxylicious is being deployed behind another proxy using a different port scheme, such as an secure OpenShift route on port 443. An example config snippet:

.Example SNI routing address provider configuration with advertised port
[source,yaml]
----
clusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider:
  type: SniRoutingClusterNetworkAddressConfigProvider
  config:
    bootstrapAddress: mycluster.kafka.com:9192                 
    advertisedBrokerAddressPattern: mybroker-$(nodeId).mycluster.kafka.com:443
    bindAddress: 192.168.0.1
----

This configuration instructs Kroxylicious to listen on port 9192, but advertise brokers of this virtual cluster as being available on port 443.

NOTE: Single port operation may have cost advantages when using load balancers of public clouds, as it allows
a single cloud provider load balancer to be shared across all virtual clusters.
