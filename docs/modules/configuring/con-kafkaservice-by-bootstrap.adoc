= Configuration for proxied Kafka clusters

A proxied Kafka cluster is configured in a `KafkaService` resource, which specifies how the proxy connects to the cluster.
The Kafka cluster may or may not be running in the same Kubernetes cluster as the proxy: Network connectivity is all that's required.

This example shows a `KafkaService` defining how to connect to a Kafka cluster at `kafka.example.com`.

.Example `KafkaService` configuration
[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaService
metadata:
  # ...
spec:
  bootstrapServers: kafka.example.com:9092 # <1>
  nodeIdRanges: # <2>
    - name: brokers # <3>
      start: 0 # <4>
      end: 5 # <5>
  # ...
----
<1> The `bootstrapServers` property is a comma-separated list of addresses in `<host>:<port>` format. Including multiple broker addresses helps clients connect when one is unavailable.
<2> `nodeIdRanges` declares the IDs of all the broker nodes in the Kafka cluster
<3> `name` is optional, but specifying it can make errors easier to diagnose.
<4> The start of the ID range, inclusive.
<5> The end of the ID range, inclusive.
