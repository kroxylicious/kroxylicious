= TLS cipher suite configuration for client-to-proxy connections

include::../../snippets/snip-tls-cipher-suite.adoc[]

.Example `VirtualKafkaCluster` configured so that the proxy will negotiate TLS connection using only the listed ciphers.
[source,yaml]

kind: VirtualKafkaCluster
metadata:

spec:

  ingresses:
    - ingressRef:
        name: cluster-ip
      tls:

           - TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
           - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

----
<1> The `cipherSuites` object configures the cipher suites.
<2> `allow` lists the cipher suites which are permitted.

The `cipherSuites` property also supports `deny`, if you prefer to list the cipher suites to exclude instead.

The names of the cipher suites supported depend on the JVM in the proxy container image.
See {cipherSuiteNames}.
