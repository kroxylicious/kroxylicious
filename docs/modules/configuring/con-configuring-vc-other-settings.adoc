== Per-virtual cluster logging

You can enable low level logging on a per-virtual cluster basis.
The `logNetwork` property controls logging of information about requests and responses at the network level, before they've been decoded into Kafka requests and responses.
The `logFrames` property controls logging of the decoded requests and responses.
