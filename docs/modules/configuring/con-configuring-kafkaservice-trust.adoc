= TLS trust configuration for proxy-to-cluster connections

By default, the proxy uses the platform's default trust store when connecting to the proxied cluster over TLS.  
This works if the cluster's TLS certificates are signed by a well-known public Certificate Authority (CA), but fails if theyâ€™re signed by a private CA instead.

IMPORTANT: It is good practice to configure trust explicitly, even when proxied cluster's TLS certificates are signed by a public CA.

This example configures a `KafkaService` to trust TLS certificates signed by any Certificate Authority (CA) listed in the `trusted-cas.pem` entry of the `ConfigMap` named `trusted-cas`.

.Example `KafkaService` configuration for trusting certificates.
[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaService
metadata:
  # ...
spec:
  bootstrapServers: kafka.example.com:9092
  tls:
    trustAnchorRef: # <1>
      kind: ConfigMap # <2>
      name: trusted-cas # <3>
      key: trusted-cas.pem # <4>
    # ...
----
<1> The `trustAnchorRef` property references a separate Kubernetes resource which contains the CA certificates to be trusted
<2> The `kind` is optional and defaults to `ConfigMap`.
<3> The `name` of the resource of the given `kind`. This resource must exist in the same namespace as the `KafkaService`
<4> The `key` identifies the entry in the given resource. The corresponding value must be a PEM-encoded set of CA certificates.
