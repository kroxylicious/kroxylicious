= A proxy to contain the virtual cluster

A `KafkaProxy` resource represents an instance of the Kroxylicious Proxy.
Conceptually, it is the top-level resource that links together `KafkaProxyIngress`, `VirtualKafkaCluster`, `KafkaService`, and `KafkaProtocolFilter` resources to form a complete working proxy.

This example shows the `KafkaProxy` referenced by `KafkaProxyIngress` and `VirtualKafkaCluster` resources.

.Example `KafkaProxy` configuration.
[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaProxy
apiVersion: kroxylicious.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  namespace: my-proxy
  name: simple
spec: {} # <1>
----
<1> For this example, we don't need to customize the proxy, so its `spec` is the empty object.
