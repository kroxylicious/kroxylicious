[id='ref-configuring-proxy-example-{context}']
= Example Kroxylicious configuration

* Virtual clusters that represent the Kafka clusters
* Network addresses for broker communication in a Kafka cluster
* Filters to introduce additional functionality to the Kafka deployment

In this example, configuration for the Record Encryption filter is shown.

----
<1> A list of named filter configurations.
<2> The type of filter, which is the Record Encryption filter using Vault as the KMS in this example.
<3> The configuration specific to the type of filter.
<4> If required, you can also specify the credentials for TLS authentication with the KMS, with key names under which TLS certificates are stored.
<5> Virtual cluster configuration.
<6> The name of the virtual cluster.
<7> The bootstrap address of the target physical Kafka Cluster being proxied.
<8> TLS configuration for the connection to the target cluster.
<9> The gateway of the virtual cluster defining how the virtual cluster is presented to the network.
<10> The identification scheme used to route traffic to brokers, which can be `sniHostIdentifiesNode` or `portIdentifiesNode`.
<11> The hostname and port of the bootstrap used by the Kafka clients to connect to the gateway. The hostname must be resolved by the clients.
<12> TLS encryption used by the gateway for securing connections with the clients.
