= Compatibility

[id='con-api-compatibility-api{context}']
== APIs

Kroxylicious follows https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-200[Semantic Versioning] rules. While we are still in the initial development phase ({unstable-api-version}), we still take API compatibility very seriously. We aim to provide at least two minor releases between deprecation and the removal of that deprecated item.

We also consider our configuration file syntax a public API (though not the Java model backing it). As such, the syntax follows the same Semantic Versioning and deprecation rules.

Kubernetes custom resources are a public API, and we are making every effort to evolve Kroxylicious custom resources in line with https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/[Kubernetes best practices]. Kubernetes resources have their own versioning scheme, which is independent of the Kroxylicious proxy service version. As a result, we may reach {stable-api-version} of Kroxylicious while still using alpha or beta versions of the custom resources.

[id='con-api-compatibility-third-party{context}']
=== Third-party plugins

Kroxylicious supports loading third-party plugins to extend the core functionality of the project. While these plugins are configured and loaded as first-class entities within Kroxylicious, we cannot guarantee the compatibility of their APIs or configuration properties.

We do however hold filters and plugins provided by the project to the same standards as the rest of the public API.

[id='con-api-compatibility-wire-protocol{context}']
== Wire protocol

Kroxylicious offers the same backwards and forwards compatibility guarantees as https://kafka.apache.org/protocol#protocol_compatibility[Apache Kafka]. We support the same range of client and broker versions as the official Apache Kafka Java client.
