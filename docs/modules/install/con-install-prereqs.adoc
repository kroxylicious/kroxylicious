= Install prerequisites

To install Kroxylicious, you will need the following:

ifndef::OpenShiftOnly[]
* A Kubernetes {KubernetesVersionMinimum} or later cluster.
+
* The `kubectl` command-line tool to be installed and configured to connect to the running cluster.

For more information on the tools available for running Kubernetes, see {KubeTools} in the Kubernetes documentation.

endif::OpenShiftOnly[]

ifdef::OpenShiftOnly[]
[discrete]

* An OpenShift {OpenShiftVersionMinimum} or later cluster.

* The `oc` command-line tool is installed and configured to connect to the running cluster.

== `oc` and `kubectl` commands

The `oc` command functions as an alternative to `kubectl`.
In almost all cases the example `kubectl` commands used in this guide can be done using `oc` simply by replacing the command name (options and arguments remain the same).

In other words, instead of using:

[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl apply -f _your-file_

when using OpenShift you can use:

[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
oc apply -f _your-file_

// NOTE: As an exception to this general rule, `oc` uses `oc adm` subcommands for _cluster management_ functionality,
// whereas `kubectl` does not make this distinction.
// For example, the `oc` equivalent of `kubectl taint` is `oc adm taint`.
