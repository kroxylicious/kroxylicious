= Kroxylicious release artifacts

[role="_abstract"]
To use YAML manifest files to install Kroxylicious, download  {OperatorAssetZipFileName} or {OperatorAssetTgzFileName} file from the {OperatorDownloadUrl}, and extract the files as appropriate (for example using `unzip` or `tar -xzf`).

Each of these archives contains:

Installation Files:: In the `install` directory are the YAML manifests needed to install the operator.

Examples:: In the `examples` directory are examples of the custom resources which can be used to deploy a proxy once the operator has been installed.
