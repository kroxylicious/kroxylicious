= Configuring virtual clusters

[role="_abstract"]
A `VirtualKafkaCluster` resource defines a logical Kafka cluster that is accessible to clients over the network.

The virtual cluster references the following:

* A `KafkaProxy` resource that the proxy is associated with.
* One or more `KafkaProxyIngress` resources that expose the virtual cluster to Kafka clients.
* A `KafkaService` resource that defined the backend Kafka cluster.
* Zero or more `KafkaProtocolFilter` resources that apply filters to the Kafka protocol traffic passing between clients and the backend Kafka cluster.
