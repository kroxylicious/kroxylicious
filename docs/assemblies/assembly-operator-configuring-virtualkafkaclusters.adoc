= Configuring virtual clusters

[role="_abstract"]
A `VirtualKafkaCluster` resource represents a logical cluster which will be made accessible to Kafka clients over the network.

It references:

a `KafkaProxy` resource:: the proxy to which it belongs
one or more `KafkaProxyIngress` resources:: each is a proxy ingress through which clients may connect
a `KafkaService` resource:: the proxied Kafka cluster
zero or more `KafkaProtocolFilter` resources:: the filters which will be applied to Kafka protocol traffic passing between clients and the proxied Kafka cluster
