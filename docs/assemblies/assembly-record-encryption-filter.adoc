[role="_abstract"]
Kroxylicious's Record Encryption filter enhances the security of Kafka messages.
The filter uses industry-standard cryptographic techniques to apply encryption to Kafka messages, ensuring the confidentiality of data stored in the Kafka Cluster.
Kroxylicious centralizes topic-level encryption, ensuring streamlined encryption across Kafka clusters.

There are three steps to using the filter:

1. Setting up a Key Management System (KMS).
2. Establishing the encryption keys within the KMS that will be used to encrypt the topics.
3. Configuring the filter within Kroxylicious.

The filter integrates with a Key Management Service (KMS), which has ultimate responsibility for the safe storage of sensitive key material.
The filter relies on a KMS implementation. 
Currently, Kroxylicious integrates with either HashiCorp Vault or AWS Key Management Service. 
You can provide implementations for your specific KMS systems. 
Additional KMS support will be added based on demand.
