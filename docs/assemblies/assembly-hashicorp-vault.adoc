= Preparing HashiCorp Vault

[role="_abstract"]
To use HashiCorp Vault with the Record Encryption filter, use the following setup:

* Enable the Transit Engine as the Record Encryption filter relies on its APIs.
* Create a Vault policy specifically for the filter with permissions for generating and decrypting Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) for envelope encryption.
* Obtain a Vault token that includes the filter policy.
