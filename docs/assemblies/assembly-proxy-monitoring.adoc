Kroxylicious supports key observability features to help you understand the performance and health of your proxy instances.

The Kroxylicious Proxy supports real-time monitoring and alerting by emitting system metrics. 
You can configure metric emission within the proxy and integrate it with a monitoring system like Prometheus to ingest and analyze the data.

The Kroxylicious Proxy writes a log so that its actions may be understood over time.
You can adjust log levels and customize logging as described in this section.
