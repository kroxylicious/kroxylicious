= Monitoring proxies

[role="_abstract"]

Kroxylicious supports key observability features to help you understand the performance and health of your proxy instances.

The Kroxylicious Proxy has the ability to emit metrics.
Metrics allow the behaviour to be monitored in real-time and alerts to be generated in the event of an abnormal condition.
The sections below show you how to configure the metrics within the proxy and how to ingest the metrics into a system like Prometheus.

The Kroxylicious Proxy writes a log so that its actions may be understood in retrospect.
The sections below show you how to adjust the log levels and use a custom logging configuration.
