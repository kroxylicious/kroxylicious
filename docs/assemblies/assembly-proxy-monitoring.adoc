= Monitoring proxies

[role="_abstract"]

Kroxylicious supports a number of observability features.
These can help you to understand the performance and health of proxy instances.
The Proxy writes a log and emits metrics in Prometheus format.

* Introduce custom logging configurations using `log4j2` and set appropriate root log levels.
* Set up an admin HTTP endpoint for Prometheus metrics scraping.
* Integrate Micrometer for enhanced observability.
* Configure common tags and standard binders for JVM and system metrics to ensure comprehensive monitoring and efficient proxy operation.
