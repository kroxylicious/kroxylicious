= Kroxylicious Proxy overview

[role="_abstract"]
Kroxylicious is an Apache Kafka protocol-aware ("Layer 7") proxy designed to enhance Kafka-based systems.
Through its filter mechanism it allows additional behavior to be introduced into a Kafka-based system without requiring changes to either your applications or the Kafka cluster itself. 
Built-in filters are provided as part of the solution.

Functioning as an intermediary, the Kroxylicious mediates communication between a Kafka cluster and its clients. 
It takes on the responsibility of receiving, filtering, and forwarding messages.

A Java API provides a convenient means for implementing custom logic within the proxy.
