= Overview of Operator Metrics

[role="_abstract"]

The  Operator is implemented using the {josdk}[Java Operator SDK].
The Java Operator SDK exposes metrics that allow its behaviour to be understood.  These metrics
are enabled by default in the Kroxylicious Operator.

Refer to the {josdk-metrics}[Java Operator SDK metric documentation] to learn more about metrics.
