= Monitoring proxies

[role="_abstract"]
Monitoring data allows you to monitor the performance and health of proxy operations. 
You can configure your deployment to capture metrics data for analysis and notifications.

* Introduce custom logging configurations using `log4j2` and set appropriate root log levels.
* Set up an admin HTTP endpoint for Prometheus metrics scraping.
* Integrate Micrometer for enhanced observability.
* Configure common tags and standard binders for JVM and system metrics to ensure comprehensive monitoring and efficient proxy operation.
