Kroxylicious supports key observability features to help you understand the performance and health of your proxy instances.

The Kroxylicious Proxy and the Kroxylicious Operator have the ability to emit metrics.
Metrics allow the behaviour to be monitored in real-time and alerts to be generated in the event of an abnormal condition.
The sections below show you how to ingest the metrics into a system like Prometheus.

The Kroxylicious Proxy and the Kroxylicious Operator write a log so that its actions may be understood in retrospect.
The section below shows you how to adjust the log levels.
