A `KafkaProxyIngress` resource defines the networking configuration that allows Kafka clients to connect to a `VirtualKafkaCluster`.

It is uniquely associated with a single `KafkaProxy` instance, but it is not uniquely associated with a `VirtualKafkaCluster`; it can be used by multiple `VirtualKafkaCluster` instances.
