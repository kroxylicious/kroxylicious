A `KafkaProxyIngress` resource expresses the networking configuration for how Kafka clients will connect to a `VirtualKafkaClister`.

It is uniquely associated with a single `KafkaProxy` instance, but it is not uniquely associated with a `VirtualKafkaCluster`; it can be used by multiple `VirtualKafkaClusters`.
