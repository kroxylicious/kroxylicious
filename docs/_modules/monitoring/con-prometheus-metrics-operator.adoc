The Kroxylicious Operator is implemented using the {josdk}[Java Operator SDK].
The Java Operator SDK exposes metrics that allow its behavior to be understood.
These metrics are enabled by default in the Kroxylicious Operator.

Refer to the {josdk-metrics}[Java Operator SDK metric documentation] to learn more about metrics.
