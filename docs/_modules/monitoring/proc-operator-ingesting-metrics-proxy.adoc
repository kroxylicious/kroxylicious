= Ingesting proxy metrics

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure describes how to ingest metrics from the Kroxylicious Proxy into Prometheus.

.Prerequisites

* Kroxylicious Operator is installed.
* An instance of Kroxylicious deployed by the operator.
ifndef::OpenShiftOnly[]
* https://prometheus-operator.dev/[Prometheus Operator] is installed, and a Prometheus instance has been created using the https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/api-reference/api/#monitoring.coreos.com/v1.Prometheus[`Prometheus` custom resource].
endif::OpenShiftOnly[]
ifdef::OpenShiftOnly[]
* Monitoring for user-defined projects is enabled on your OpenShift cluster and a Prometheus instance has been created.

.Procedure

.  Apply the PodMonitor configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
  name: proxy
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: kroxylicious
      app.kubernetes.io/component: proxy
  podMetricsEndpoints:
  - path: /metrics
    port: management
----
+
The Prometheus Operator reconfigures Prometheus automatically.
Prometheus begins to regularly to scrape the proxy's metric.

. Check the metrics are being ingested using a PromQL query such as:
