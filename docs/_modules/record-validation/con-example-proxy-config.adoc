= Example proxy configuration file

If your instance of the Kroxylicious Proxy runs directly on an operating system, provide the filter configuration in the `filterDefinitions` list of your proxy configuration.
Here's a complete example of a `filterDefinitions` entry configured for record validation:

// .Example `filterDefinitions` configuration {foo}
[source,yaml]

filterDefinitions:
  - name: my-record-validation
    type: RecordValidation
    config:
        rules:
        - topicNames:                                                  # <1>
            - <topic name>
          keyRule:
