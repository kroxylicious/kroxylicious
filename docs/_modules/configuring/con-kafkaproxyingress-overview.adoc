= Networking configuration

A `KafkaProxyIngress` resource defines the networking configuration that allows Kafka clients to connect to a `VirtualKafkaCluster`.

It is uniquely associated with a single `KafkaProxy` instance, but it is not uniquely associated with a `VirtualKafkaCluster` and can be used by multiple `VirtualKafkaCluster` instances.

The `KafkaProxyIngress` resource supports the following ingress types to configure networking access to the virtual cluster:

* `clusterIP` exposes the virtual cluster to applications running inside the same Kubernetes cluster as the proxy.
* `loadBalancer` exposes the virtual cluster to applications running outside the Kubernetes cluster.

The `clusterIP` ingress types support both TCP (plain) and TLS connections.
The `loadBalancer` type exclusively supports TLS.

When using TLS, you specify a TLS server certificate in the ingress configuration of the `VirtualKafkaCluster` resource.

When using `loadBalancer`, changes to your DNS may be required.

The following table summarizes the supported ingress types.

.Supported ingress types
|===
|Ingress Type|Use case|Supported Transport|Requires DNS changes?

|`clusterIP`
|On-cluster applications
|TCP/TLS
|No

|`loadBalancer`
|Off-cluster applications
|TLS only
|Yes
|===

IMPORTANT: TLS is recommended when connecting applications in a production environment.

== `clusterIP` ingress type

The `clusterIP` ingress type exposes virtual clusters to Kafka clients running in the same Kubernetes cluster as the proxy. 
It supports both TCP (plain) and TLS connections.

The `clusterIP` ingress type uses Kubernetes `Service` resources of type `ClusterIP` to enable on-cluster access.

.Example `KafkaProxyIngress` configuration for `clusterIP` with TCP
[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaProxyIngress
apiVersion: kroxylicious.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  namespace: my-proxy
  name: cluster-ip
spec:
  proxyRef: # <1>
    name: simple
  clusterIP: # <2>
    protocol: TCP # <3>
----
<1> Identifies the `KafkaProxy` resource that this ingress is part of.
<2> Specifies `clusterIP` networking.
<3> Defines the connection protocol as plain `TCP`. Use `TLS` to enable encrypted communication between clients and the proxy.

.Example `KafkaProxyIngress` configuration for `clusterIP` with TLS
[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaProxyIngress
apiVersion: kroxylicious.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  namespace: my-proxy
  name: cluster-ip
spec:
  proxyRef: # <1>
    name: simple
  clusterIP: # <2>
    protocol: TLS # <3>
----

When using TLS, specify a xref:con-virtualkafkacluster-clusterip-generate-tls-certificates-{context}[TLS server certificate] in the xref:con-virtualkafkacluster-overview-{context}[ingress configuration] of the `VirtualKafkaCluster` resource using a `certificateRef`.

== `loadBalancer` ingress type

The `loadBalancer` ingress type allows applications running off-cluster to connect to the virtual cluster.
TLS must be used with this ingress type.

The `loadBalancer` ingress type uses Kubernetes `Service` resources of type `LoadBalancer` to enable off-cluster access.

When using a loadBalancer ingress, the proxy uses SNI (Server Name Indication) to match the clientâ€™s requested host name to the correct virtual cluster and broker within the proxy.
This means that every virtual cluster and every broker within the virtual cluster *must* be uniquely identifiable within DNS.
To accomplish this, the following configuration must be provided:

* A unique `bootstrapAddress`. This is the address that the clients initially use to connect to the virtual cluster.
* An `advertisedBrokerAddressPattern` that generates unique broker addresses which clients use to connect to individual brokers.

You decide how to formulate the `bootstrapAddress` and the `advertisedBrokerAddressPattern` to best fit the networking conventions of your organization.

The `advertisedBrokerAddressPattern` *must* contain the token `$(nodeId)`.
The proxy replaces this token with the broker's node ID.
This ensures that client connections are correctly routed to the intended broker.

Both `bootstrapAddress` and `advertisedBrokerAddressPattern` *may* contain the token `$(virtualClusterName)`.
If this is present, it is replaced by the virtual cluster's name.
This token is necessary when the `KafkaProxyIngress` is being shared by many virtual clusters.

One possible scheme is to use the virtual cluster's name as a subdomain within your organisation's domain name:

[source,text]
----
$(virtualClusterName).kafkaproxy.example.com
----

You can then use a further subdomain for each broker:

[source,text]
----
broker-$(nodeId).$(virtualClusterName).kafkaproxy.example.com
----

You can use other naming schemes, as long as each address remains unique.

.Example `KafkaProxyIngress` configuration for `loadBalancer`
[source,yaml]
----
kind: KafkaProxyIngress
apiVersion: kroxylicious.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  namespace: my-proxy
  name: load-balancer
spec:
  proxyRef: # <1>
    name: simple
  loadBalancer: # <2>
    bootstrapAddress: "$(virtualClusterName).kafkaproxy.example.com" # <3>
    advertisedBrokerAddressPattern: "broker-$(nodeId).$(virtualClusterName).kafkaproxy.example.com" # <4>
----
<1> Identifies the `KafkaProxy` resource that this ingress is part of.
<2> Specifies `loadBalancer` networking.
<3> The bootstrap address for clients to connect to the virtual cluster.
<4> The advertised broker address used by the proxy to generate the individual broker addresses presented to the client.

When using TLS, specify a xref:con-virtualkafkacluster-loadbalancer-generate-tls-certificates-{context}[TLS server certificate] in the xref:con-virtualkafkacluster-overview-{context}[ingress configuration] of the `VirtualKafkaCluster` resource using a `certificateRef`.

You must also xref:proc-virtualkafkacluster-loadbalancer-dns-config-{context}[configure DNS] so that the bootstrap and broker address resolve from the network used by the applications.
