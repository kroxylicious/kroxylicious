Kroxylicious supports key observability features to help you understand the performance and health of your proxy instances.

The Kroxylicious Proxy and Kroxylicious Operator generate metrics for real-time monitoring and alerting, as well as logs that capture their actions and behavior. 
You can integrate these metrics with a monitoring system like Prometheus for ingestion and analysis, while configuring log levels to control the granularity of logged information.
