= (Preview) Record Validation filter

[role="_abstract"]
The Record Validation filter validates records sent by a producer.
Only records that pass the validation are sent to the broker.
This filter can be used to prevent _poison messages_—such as those containing corrupted data or invalid formats—from entering the Kafka system, which may otherwise lead to consumer failure.

The filter currently supports two modes of operation:

1. Schema Validation ensures the content of the record conforms to a schema stored in an https://www.apicur.io/registry/[Apicurio Registry].
2. JSON Syntax Validation ensures the content of the record contains syntactically valid JSON.

Validation rules can be applied to check the content of the Kafka record key or value.

If the validation fails, the product request is rejected and the producing application receives an error response.  The broker
will not receive the rejected records.

NOTE: This filter is currently in incubation and available as a preview.
We would not recommend using it in a production environment.
