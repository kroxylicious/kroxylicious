         * This delegate is ugly. The problem it is solving is:
         *
         * 1. We want the proxy to avoid deserializing requests and responses "when it doesn't have to"
         * * So when there isn't a filter which is interested in that request/response API, or API version
         * * And when the proxy infra itself doesn't need to
         * 2. With the SASL offload support the proxy itself (when configured) is interested in the SASL APIs.
         * 3. But it doesn't know, until it's got to the invoking the `NetFilter` impl and that having called
         * back on the `NetFilterContext`, what protocol filters are to be used.
         * 4. But it's the `KafkaDecodeFilter` which needs to know about decodability, and that sits in front
         * of the `KafkaProxyFrontendHandler`, so there's a cyclic dependency.
         * 5. It's easier to use this delegation pattern than it is to try to reconfigure
         * the predicate on the `KafkaDecodeFilter`.
